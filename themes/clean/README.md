# Clean - A spotless Odin theme

I'm no fancy designer and so if I do any designing, I'll try to go for a clean look with semantic markup.

The result is that this theme is very basic and only offers three different views:

 - **Home** which is a customized landing page showing the last four posts
 - **Single** which is the view for a single post/page
 - **Listing** which displays a bunch of posts
