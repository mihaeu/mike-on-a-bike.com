Hey I'm Michael and this is my travel blog. Aside from traveling I'm really passionate about software engineering and especially web development.

I've used Wordpress for quite a while and was forced to use it for some work-related projects, but even though it is a great piece of software, it's just a pain to use for developers and most importantly it's slow (to develop and to load) and boooring.

So I wrote my own static site generator odin and used it for this blog. Now I can finally focus on content with easy deployment and without having to worry about security, backups etc.

While odin is still under heavy development, I feel it is going in the right direction and might just fill the need for static blog generators in PHP (if you are comfortable with Python, Ruby or NodeJS I'd recommend Pelican, Jekyll, Assemble instead).
