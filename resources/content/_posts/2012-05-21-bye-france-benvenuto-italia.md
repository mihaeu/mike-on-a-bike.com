## Making the switch from Baguettes to Ciabattas

So after some hardships I finally made it into Italy &#8230;

[<img alt="Winding roads all the way up to every pass I had to take in the French alps" ilo-full-src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/7240724214_6e0ee47f2a_m.jpg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/7240724214_6e0ee47f2a_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px; border: 3px solid black; float: left;margin:5px;" />][1]On my last few days in France (<a href="http://mike-on-a-bike.com/route/" target="_blank" title="My route so far">see map</a>) I went from Digne over my first pass to Nice. After Nice I had to go back into the Alps and clear another three passes. All in all those passes had a total of more than 4000m and taking into account that I was already a bit worn out from riding against headwinds during the past few weeks, I was quite happy to leave the mountains behind me.

[<img alt="Pino helped me through the tunnel with his Pickup truck" ilo-full-src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7215/7240718922_cde4032459_m.jpg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7215/7240718922_cde4032459_m.jpg" style="width: 240px; height: 180px; float: right; border: 3px solid black;margin:5px;" />][2]

It turns out that I was quite lucky, because there was a tunnel after the last pass which I would not have been allowed to go through by bicycle. Of course nobody bothered to tell me about that seemingly unimportant fact, when I was asking for directions to the tunnel. In any case when the police told me to go back (down the mountain I just climbed, to another pass) an Italian couple came to my rescue and shuttled my bike and me through the tunnel.

## Plans for Europe

I think I now have a more or less clear picture of how I am going to spend my next couple of months. For now I will make my way straight across Italy along the Po river (I am going without maps since I left Germany, but how hard can it be to just follow along a river?), which means I don't have to worry about mountains for the next one or two weeks.

Afterwards I am going to go in Slovenia &#8211; hoping that after I visited both Slovakia and Slovenia I will be able to tell both countries apart &#8211; and then I am going to more or less follow the route I had already planned for the Balkan area.

So I think I will not go into China along the silk road through Kazakhstan, but instead I am going to go around Pakistan by taking a ferry from Iran to the UAE or Oman and then to India. From India I will make my way into China.

Or something along those lines &#8230;

But all of that won't matter much until the end of this year, for now I am just looking forward to an awesome summer in SE Europe. So without further ado here is a map that shows some of the places I intend to go to within the next few months:
