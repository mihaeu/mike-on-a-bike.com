A couple of days back I celebrated my 100th day on the road (by eating a huge water melon of course) and so now this trip is officially my longest bicycle trip both in time and distance.

For those of you who also like to travel I decided to share all the information that I gathered about this trip:

<span style="font-size:16px;">Days Travelled: 100<br /> Days Cycled: 73<br /> Total Distance: 5106.87 km<br /> Average Distance / Day: 69.96 km<br /> Average Distance / Day (inc. rest days): 51.07 km<br /> Average Speed: 14.93 km/h<br /> Average Time Cycling / Day: 4 h 40 min<br /> Total Money Spent: 837.55 &euro;<br /> Money Spent / Day: 8.38 &euro;<br /> Total Money Spent on Accomodation: 0 &euro;<br /> Countries Visited: 11</span>

And a little less factual:

<span style="font-size:16px;">Scars: 10+<br /> Watermelons: 100kg+<br /> Mosquito/Bug Bites: 99999+<br /> Other RTW travellers I met: 4<br /> Favourite Country: Bosnia and Herzegowina<br /> Favourite People: Serbs<br /> Best food: Serbia (Burek!)<br /> Most beautiful women: Serbia (Belgrade!)<br /> Most Expensive Country: Italy<br /> Cheapest country: Albania</span>  
<span style="font-size:16px;">Pages Read: 5000+</span>  
<span style="font-size:16px;">Longest time w/o shower: 7 days </span>  
<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-size:10px;">(during my first week it was really cold, now I shower almost every day)</span></span>  
&nbsp;

8 Euros a day might seem low for those who are used to different styles of travel, but when you don't have to spend money on transportation or accomodation, then 8 Euros (on average) is just enough for me to eat whatever I want and also to occasionally eat in restaurants and to get my daily caffeine fix in cafes/bars.

The upcoming countries will be even cheaper, but some of them require visas and there will also be need for other modes of transportation (ferries or maybe even plain tickets). All in all my plan is to spend less than 10 Euros a day, but even if I end up spending more I should be ok for quite a while.

So this is my life right now, if you have any other questions, feel free to ask me ANYTHING <img src='http://localhost/mike-on-a-bike.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
