Believe it or not, long-term travel can wear you out. After a while we all want to stop. It's not the physical part as one might expect. Actually already after a few months you won't experience this so much anymore. The body easily adapts to getting up my Brooks saddle every day until it's time to get back to sleep on a rocky uneven camp-spot.

Come to think of it, it happened quite a lot that I stopped at rest stations where people complain about sitting in a car for four hours, while I just did a couple of hours on the saddle.

No it's definitely not the body, it's the mind that gets tired after a while. On a trip like this you do a lot of things that would fall into the category "unspeakable" for most people, but like it or not after a while it becomes your every day life.

Meeting new and different people every day is great, saying goodbye to each and every one of them, is not always that great.

So we felt like being in one place, meeting the same people and eating in the same places for a while. Since we were a bit tired of the typical South East Asia crowd (more about that later) we decided to go to Nepal instead.

Nepal has been described to us as *India light* and after the countless stories that we heard about the hardships of traveling through India, that sounded like a good thing.

If I had to describe the country with ten keywords I would probably come up with something like this:

    mountains, tourism, hinduism, good food, low budget, colorful, dirty, buddhism, dhal bhat, cold

We got a three-months multiple entry visa on arrival at the airport and took a taxi into the touristic center of town: **Thamel**.

Thamel is awesome, noisy, dirty and colorful. Just the right place to get into the spirit of the South Asian sub-continent. It took us about a week to find an apartment in an area that was to our liking.

We're living in Nepal since about a 1.5 months now.
