title: Route
---
This is just to give you guys a rough idea of what I had in mind. My route will change as I go along and will probably look completely different after just a couple of months. Anyways this is what I came up with after running my fingers across globes since I was a young boy:[<div id="attachment_59" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 594px">
  <img src="../wp-content/uploads/2012/04/karte_opt-1024x609.jpg" alt="The route of my bicycle tour around the world." title="karte_opt" class="size-large wp-image-59 wp-caption aligncenter wp-caption aligncenter" width="584" height="347" /><p class="wp-caption-text">
    The route of my bicycle tour around the world.
  </p>
</div>][1]

And this is my progress so far:
