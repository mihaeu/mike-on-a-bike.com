<div id="nanoGallery"></div>

I upload all my photos to my Flickr account:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><span style="font-size:16px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mike-on-a-bike/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mike-on-a-bike/</a></span></strong>
</p>

I will try to upload my photos as often as possible, but getting a decent internet connection while on the road can be a real pain &#8230;
